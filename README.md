This is my first attempt at using Unity to create a game

Controls:
A           - move left
D           - move right
Space or W  - jump

Features:
Camera follows ball
Added directional light and shadows
Level resets when ball falls



notes:
Textures from cgtextures.com
Debug.Log(String) is a console printer for debugging
